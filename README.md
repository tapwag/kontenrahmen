# Chart of accounts for SQL Ledger / Kontenrahmen f√ºr SQL Ledger

This repository contains some charts of accounts which can be used for SQL Ledger, a web-based ERP-solution written in Perl5.

There is a chart of accounts of the German "Industriekontenrahmen" which (theoretically) enables SQL Ledger to be used in schools who teach accounting or bookeeping.

#To Do / Projects to come:

SQL Ledger already supports the German Standard Kontenrahmen (SKR03) out of the box when creating a new tenant in version 3.0 but this chart of accounts is fairly old and would need to be checked and (most likely) updated.

Also I am hoping to get something underway for SKR04. kivitendo already supports this but apparently their accounting engine has been completely rewritten since Lx-Office forked from SQL Ledger and became kivitendo later on.
